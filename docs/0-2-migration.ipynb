    "# Migrating to 0.2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0.2.0 release contains a handful of breaking changes compared to the previous 0.1.x releases.  This guide will list out these changes as well as how to migrate to the new features that encompass them in 0.2.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pydantic Support\n",
    "\n",
    "In 0.1.x, Guardrails supported pydantic models with a `register_pydantic` decorator.  This decorator has been removed in 0.2.x and replaced with the `Guard.from_pydantic` method.  This method takes in a pydantic model and returns a `Guard` instance that can be used to validate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To migrate from the `register_pydantic` decorator to the `Guard.from_pydantic` method, instantiate the model outside of the decorator and pass it into the `Guard.from_pydantic` method.  If you wish to continue using validators defined on the model with Guardrails, you must define them separately and register them with the `register_validator` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, see the following example migration from a 0.1.x-style rail spec defines a model with the `register_pydantic` decorator to a 0.2.x-style Guard constructed from a pydantic model:\n",

    "## String Formatting In Prompts\n",
    "Previously Guardrails used `f-string`'s and `str.format` to include prompt variables, prompt primitives, and other partials in the prompt sent to the LLM.  This necessitated any braces, aka curly brackets, to be escaped with additional braces to prevent its contents from being considered as variable that should be substituted during string formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now use `Template.safe_substitute` to avoid this issue completely.  This does, however, require a change to how variables are expressed in string arguments such as prompts and instructions.  Now instead of expressing a variable for the prompt as `{{my_var}}`, it should be expressed as `${my_var}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this change in variable syntax, we have also started namespacing our prompt primitives.  Whereas before you would use one of our built in primitives like so: `@complete_json_suffix_v2`, they should now be specified as `${gr.complete_json_suffix_v2}`.\n",

    "### Using Guardrails With LangChain\n",
    "The changes to string format also effect the Guardrails AI integration with LangChain.  Since LangChain supports `f-string`'s and `jinja2` for templating, and the `GuardrailsOutputParser` opts for the `f-string` option, any braces in the prompt must be escaped before instantiating the LangChain `PromptTemplate`.  To make this easy, we added an `escape` method on our prompt class to handle this for you; you simply need to invoke it when passing the prompt to `PromptTemplate` like so:\n",
